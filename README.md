### Sit back, relax, and watch your trains drive around! 
This mod creates a dynamic screensaver which follows trains as they drive around from station to station delivering your goods. 

The screensaver is very configurable; it is suggested to adjust mod settings depending on your train setup for optimal results.

Please report any issues or suggestions on the [Discussion](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/trainsaver/discussion) page.
